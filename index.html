	<p class="about"> <!-- reword this paragraph -->
		Trukeep is owned and operated by one person, me. My name is Diana Jane Etges, and I've been working as both a bookkeeper and a payroll manager for a property management firm for the past 5+ years. I've helped the owners of property to manage their expenses, get a better sense of where their money is heading, and how to trim the fat and be more profitable. I can help you as well! My attention to detail and drive to achieve perfection will translate to more effective use of resources, and therefore more growth for your business and better lives for you and your employees. <br />Have a smaller business? Great! I love to help small businesses grow with modern bookkeepping that is affordable, precise, and efficient. Please feel free to contact me at any time if you have more questions.

	<details>
		<summary>What is an virtual online bookkeepper?</summary>
		<p class="tab">A virtual online bookkeeper is simply a bookkeeper that you meet and interact with online. You have 24/7 access to your bookkeeper via online tools like Dropbox<sup>&copy;</sup> and Google Drive<sup>&copy;</sup>, and can submit daily or weekly statements in a matter of minutes.</p>
	</details>
		
	<details>
		<summary>Why is a virtual bookkeeper better than a traditional bookkeeping service?</summary>
		<p class="tab">A virtual bookkeeper has the advantage of modern communication and cloud-based data transfer. By meeting online, and having access to vital financial reports and statements at any time means you spend less time on finances, and more time doing the things you love and helping your business thrive. </p>
	</details>

	<details>
		<summary>How can virtual bookkeeping help my business?</summary>
		<p class="tab">A virtual bookkeeper doesn't have to travel, doesn't have to arrange a time to meet, and doesn't have to visit on a regular schedule to collect statements from your business to examine your expenses and income. A virtual online bookkeeper can manage and monitor your expenses and income, which over time means you have fewer missed opportunities and fewer wasted resources. </p>
